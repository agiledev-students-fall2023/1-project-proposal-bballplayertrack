## What to include

Your proposal must focus on the product's value proposition, including answers to the questions below. Keep it thorough but concise. If you are not clear on whether your writing is any good, consult with a friend.

### Title
BBall Player Track

### What and why?

The BBall PlayerTrack is a web application that allows users to track the performance of their favorite NBA player The application will be built using the MERN stack. Very often, it is hard to get live statistics of multiple NBA players in real time and is a tedious and time consuming task for people maintaining spreadsheets. This project would automate this process saving consumers a lot of time. 

### For whom?
 
There are tens of millions of fantasy sports players with approximately 30% playing fantasy basketball. This will make the task of keeping up with different players much easier. NBA parlays also is a huge market where many people need to keep up with historical data in order to predict the performance of the players they pick for their parlays. They can use this app to make decisions in picking the right players for their parlays. There are often trends to be observed in regards to player performance, which they can use this web application to observe such trends. Other types of sports betting could also utilize this web application to make the best decision in regards to basketball teams and pkayers. These would be the targeted end-users

A lot of my friends are into player parlays in Basketball, and they voice the difficulty in obtaining historical performance that determines the trend of a

### How?
The system will have user verication system, a player selection system/statistics, game schedules, user profiles, and our own in-house 'BBall Prediction' statistics for determining player trend. The in-house 'BBall Prediction' will be used to determine a predicted number of points, assists, rebounds and blocks for a selected player.

### Scope
This project will be as ambitious as the number of features added, however I believe that the current features would take a reasonable time from a group of 4-6 programmers, I do believe that it applies MERN stack technologies to a real world scenario
